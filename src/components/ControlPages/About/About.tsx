          Lingwars is a language guessing game that offers audio samples of more
          than 300 languages. You listen to a short audio clip and are asked to
          identify what language was being spoken.
        </p>
        <p>
          At Lingwars we know that languages are the key to understanding other
          cultures as well as your own. "How many languages you speak, how many
          times you are a human". While we genuinely believe it's a true
          statement, we decided to put our efforts to bring the worldâ€™s
          languages, dialects and accents to a wider audience in an
          entertaining, engaging way.
        </p>

          Many people would agree that it feels just amazing if you can speak
          many languages or even if you are able to say a couple of words to the
          locals in a foreign country. While it all sounds exciting, it's a real
          challenge to learn new language. You can also forget a language if you
          do not actively use it. We can say that it's not possible to know all
          languages, but being able to tell the difference between them is a
          true skill. And Lingwars is here for you to help you upgrade this
          skill.
